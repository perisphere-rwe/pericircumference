# Results change log

Use this file to keep track of what you changed in the current version of the results. Collaborators often appreciate a short bullet list of items that have changed since the last time they received results, although you probably won't be expected to provide that when you share version 1. Examples of things you might write for version 2 are written below. Grow the versions up, with 1 at the bottom and the most recent unreleased version at the top. 

## Version 3 (unreleased)

Add bullets in the unreleased section when you make the changes. Don't wait until you're about to release the new version (you'll forget some of the important changes if you do that).

1. Added a figure describing TOPIC (see Figure A, page 8)
